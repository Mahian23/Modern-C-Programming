# Modern-C-Programming
After stumbling on week 4 of CS50x by sir David Malan, I decided to conquer C to a "decent" amount and stumbled upon "K.N. King's C Programming: A Modern Approach".

I took it upon myself to finish the whole book (I mean exercising) within a month and get back to CS50x (and actually finish the whole CS50x and it's sister courses) faster than the earth moves round the Sun!
This is just a small portion of my journey through the "C Programming; A Modern Approach". I strongly believe I can finish this gold mine before the February flowers bloom, while also looking  out for the numbers 
(and the big machines) to not swallow me whole!

But...

Who

Knows?
